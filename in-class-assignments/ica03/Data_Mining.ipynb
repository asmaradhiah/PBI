Also, make sure to check out `Datasets` menu, where you can find tens of thousands of real-world data set for free.

There are actually a lot more things to cover just for this topic of data mining and what you just saw above are just a tip of the iceberg. But don't worry. As long as you understand the principles above, learning other tools/methods shouldn't be a big challenge, but just a little bit of investment of time to get to know all those commands and etc."
